Hourly Precipitation Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for hourly precipitation using the NOAA dataset. Accurate forecasting is essential for various sectors, including agriculture and disaster management. By analyzing historical weather data with machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance prediction accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset includes key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. We preprocess the data to ensure quality and relevance, selecting features that improve model performance.

Methodology
The project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to predict hourly precipitation, and performance metrics are evaluated to identify the best model.

Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or expand the analysis are welcome
